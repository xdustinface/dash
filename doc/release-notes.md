Dash Core version 0.16
======================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new major version release, bringing new features, various bugfixes
and other improvements.

This is release is mandatory for masternodes and optional for other nodes.
***TODO: this won't be true if block reward reallocation code is going to be included***

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

When upgrading from a version prior to 0.14.0.3, the
first startup of Dash Core will run a migration process which can take a few
minutes to finish. After the migration, a downgrade to an older version is only
possible with a reindex (or reindex-chainstate).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.14.0.3

Downgrading to a version smaller than 0.14.0.3 is not supported anymore due to
changes in the "evodb" database format. If you need to use an older version,
you have to perform a reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

### Downgrade of masternodes to < 0.16

Starting with this release, masternodes will verify protocol versions of other
masternodes. This will cause PoSe punishment/banning of downgraded masternodes,
so it is not recommended to downgrade masternodes.

Notable changes
===============

Concentrated Recovery
---------------------
In the current system, signature shares are propagated to all LLMQ members,
until one of them has enough shares collected to recover the signature. Until
this recovered signature is propagated in the LLMQ, all members will keep
propagating shares and verifying each one. This causes quite some load on the
LLMQ, which will be avoided with the new system.

The new system sends all shares to only a single deterministically selected node,
so that this node can recover the signature and propagate the recovered signature.
This way only the recovered signature needs to be propagated and verified by all
members. After sending the share to this single node, each member waits for some
time and repeats sending it to another deterministically selected member. This
process is repeated until a recovered signature is finally created and propagated.

The new system is activated with the newly added `SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED`.

Increased number of masternode connections
------------------------------------------
To implement "Concentrated Recovery", it is now required that all members of a LLMQ
connect to all other members of the same LLMQ. This increases general connection count
for masternodes a lot. These intra-quorum connections are less resource consuming than
normal p2p connections as they only exchange LLMQ/masternode related messages, but
the hardware and network requirements will still be higher than before.

This change will at first only be activated for the smaller LLMQs (50 members) and
then later for the larger ones (400 members).

This is also controlled via `SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED`.

Masternode Connection Probing
-----------------------------
While each member must have a connection to each other member, it's not necessary
for all members to actually connect to all other members. This is because only
one of a pair of two masternodes need to initiate the connection while the other one can
wait for an incoming connection. Probing is done in the case where a masternode doesn't
really need an outbound connection, but still wants to verify that the other side
has its port open. This is done by initiating a short lived connection, waiting
for `MNAUTH` to succeed and then disconnecting again.

After this process, each member of a LLMQ knows which members are unable to accept
connections, after which they will vote on these members to be "bad".

Masternode Minimum Protocol Version Checks
------------------------------------------
Members of LLMQs will now also check all other members for minimum protocol versions
while in DKG. If a masternode determines that another LLMQ member has a protocol
version that is too low, it will vote for the other member to be "bad".

PoSe punishment/banning
-----------------------
If 80% of all LLMQ members voted for the same member to be bad, it is excluded
in the final stages of the DKG. This causes the bad masternode to get PoSe punished
and then eventually PoSe banned.

Network performance improvements
--------------------------------
This version of Dash Core includes multiple optimizations to the network and p2p message
handling code. The most important one is the introduction of `epoll` on linux-based
systems. This removes most of the CPU overhead caused by the sub-optimal use of `select`,
which could easily use up 50-80% of the CPU time spent in the network thread when many
connections were involved.

Other improvements were made to the p2p message handling code, so that for example LLMQ
related connections do less work than full/normal p2p connections.

Wallet files
------------
The `--wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring
wallets to be located in the -walletdir directory.

If `--wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat
data file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `--walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

When Dash Core is not started with any `--wallet=<path>` options, the name of
the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If Dash Core is started
with any `--wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.

PrivateSend improvements
------------------------
A new algorithm for creation of mixing denominations was implemented which
should reduce the number of the smallest inputs created and give users more
control on soft and hard caps.

GUI changes
-----------
***TODO: Lots of GUI elements were reworked internally and the look of some of them
was significantly improved.***

The "PrivateSend" checkbox was removed from the "Send" tab. There is a new tab
called "PrivateSend" which allows spending fully mixed coins only now.
Advanced users who use CoinControl feature will have all selected non-mixed
coins unselected when switching from "Send" to "PrivateSend" tab and
non-mixed coins won't even appear in the CoinControl dialog if it was opened
on the "PrivateSend" tab.

The "Pay To" field on "Send" and "PrivateSend" tabs accepts not only plain
Dash addresses but also Dash URIs now. The Dash address and the amount from
the URI are assigned to corresponding fields automatically.

Sporks
------
`SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED` was added to control Concentrated Recovery and
Masternode Probing activation. Sporks `SPORK_15_DETERMINISTIC_MNS_ENABLED`,
`SPORK_16_INSTANTSEND_AUTOLOCKS` and `SPORK_20_INSTANTSEND_LLMQ_BASED` which
were previously deprecated in v0.15 are completely removed now.

Build system
------------
The minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile Dash Core is now 4.8.
The minimum version of Qt is now 5.5.1. Some packages in `depends/` as well as
`secp256k1` and `leveldb` subtrees were updated to newer versions.

RPC changes
-----------
There are a few changes in existing RPC interfaces in this release:
- `getpeerinfo` has new field `masternode` to indicate whether connection was
  due to masternode connection attempt
- `getprivatesendinfo` `denoms` field was replaced by `denoms_goal` and
  `denoms_hardcap`
- `listunspent` has new filter option `coinType` to be able to filter different
  types of coins (all, mixed etc.)
- `protx diff` returns more detailed information about new quorums
- `quorum dkgstatus` shows `quorumConnections` for each LLMQ with detailed
  information about each participating masternode
- `quorum sign` has an optional `quorumHash` argument to pick the exact quorum
- `socketevents` in `getnetworkinfo` rpc shows the socket events mode,
  either `epoll`, `poll` or `select`

There are also new RPC commands:
- `quorum selectquorum` returns the quorum that would/should sign a request

There are also new RPC commands backported from Bitcoin Core 0.16:
- `help-console` for more info about using console in Qt
- `loadwallet` loads a wallet from a wallet file or directory
- `rescanblockchain` rescans the local blockchain for wallet related transactions
- `savemempool` dumps the mempool to disk

Please check Bitcoin Core 0.16 release notes in a [section](#backports-from-bitcoin-core-016)
below and `help <command>` in rpc for more information.

Command-line options
--------------------
Changes in existing cmd-line options:

New cmd-line options:
- `--llmqdevnetparams`
- `--llmqtestparams`
- `--privatesenddenomsgoal`
- `--privatesenddenomshardcap`
- `--socketevents`
- ***TODO: qt/gui related ones***
- ***TODO: `--disablegovernance`***

below and `Help -> Command-line options` in Qt wallet or `dashd --help` for more information.

Backports from Bitcoin Core 0.16
--------------------------------

Most of the changes between Bitcoin Core 0.15 and Bitcoin Core 0.16 have been
backported into Dash Core 0.16. We only excluded backports which do not align
with Dash, like SegWit or RBF related changes.
